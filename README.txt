This is my final project for CIS 1051. This is a Java Minecraft Mod that adds a Snow Leopard entity to the game.

As of this submission, this is an incomplete mod, but it does run. I was unable to complete certain features that I had wanted to add. I encountered struggles when adding the animations and when trying to code the natural spawning of the entity into the world. It is missing features that will likely be added in the future such as working animations, spawning in the world, other entities, items, and blocks, and more. I enjoy coding and will continue to work on this project.
